    <h1>Top ten mistakes of web design</h1>

Since my first attempt in 1996, I have compiled many top-10 lists of the biggest
mistakes in Web design. See links to all these lists at the bottom of
this article. This article presents the highlights: the very worst mistakes of
Web design. (Updated 2011.)
<br>
1. Bad Search
Overly literal search engines reduce usability in that they're unable to handle typos, plurals, hyphens, and other variants of the query terms. Such search engines
are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-for-senior-citizens/">particularly difficult for elderly users</a>, but they hurt everybody.
<br><br>
A related problem is when search engines prioritize results purely on the basis
of how many query terms they contain, rather than on each document's
importance. Much better if your search engine calls out &quot;best bets&quot;
at the top of the list â€” especially for important queries, such as the names of
your products. Search is the user's lifeline when navigation fails. Even though advanced search can
sometimes help, <a
href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/">simple search usually works best</a>, and search should be presented as a
simple box, since that's what users are looking for.
<br><br>
2. PDF Files for Online Reading
Users hate coming across a PDF file while browsing, because it breaks their flow.
Even simple things like printing or saving documents are difficult because
standard browser commands don't work. Layouts are often optimized for a sheet
of paper, which rarely matches the size of the user's browser window. Bye-bye
smooth scrolling. Hello tiny fonts. Worst of all, PDF is an undifferentiated blob of content that's hard to navigate. PDF is great for printing and for distributing manuals and other big documents that
need to be printed. Reserve it for this purpose and convert any information
that needs to be browsed or read on the screen into real web pages.
